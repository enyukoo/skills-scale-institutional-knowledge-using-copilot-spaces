## Tips for Effective Handoffs
- Start early: Begin handoff process 2-4 weeks before transition when possible
- Document as you go: Don't wait until the end to write everything down
- Use multiple formats: Combine written docs, recorded walkthroughs, and live sessions
- Overcommunicate: It's better to share too much than too little
- Focus on context: Explain not just what, but why decisions were made
- Be patient: Allow time for questions and repetition
