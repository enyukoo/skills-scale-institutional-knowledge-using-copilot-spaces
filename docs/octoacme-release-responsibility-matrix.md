# OctoAcme â€” Release Responsibility Matrix (RACI)

## Purpose
Define clear ownership and accountability for release activities using the RACI model:
- **R**esponsible: Does the work
- **A**ccountable: Ultimately answerable for the work (only one A per activity)
- **C**onsulted: Provides input and expertise
- **I**nformed: Kept updated on progress

## How to Use
- Use this matrix during release planning to clarify roles
- Update for your specific project if roles differ
- Reference during go/no-go meetings to ensure all stakeholders are aligned

- **Who**: Project Manager escalates to Product Manager and engineering leadership
- **SLA**: Resolution within 4 hours

### Level 3: Executive
- **When**: Business-critical issues, major security incidents, customer-facing outages
- **Who**: Product Manager escalates to executive sponsor
- **SLA**: Immediate response

## Customization Guide

To adapt this matrix for your project:

1. **Add/Remove Roles**: Adjust columns based on your team structure
2. **Modify Activities**: Add project-specific release activities
3. **Adjust RACI**: Change assignments based on team capabilities and preferences
4. **Document Exceptions**: Note any deviations from standard process
5. **Review Regularly**: Update matrix based on retrospective feedback

---

## Tips for Using RACI Effectively

- **One Accountable per Activity**: Avoid diffusion of responsibility
- **Limit Consulted Roles**: Too many can slow down decisions
- **Distinguish R from A**: Responsible does the work; Accountable owns the outcome
- **Review at Kickoff**: Ensure all parties understand and agree to their roles
- **Update as Needed**: Adjust if roles change during the project
