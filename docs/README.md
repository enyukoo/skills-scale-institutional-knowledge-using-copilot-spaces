# OctoAcme Project Management Processes — Overview

This document provides a concise overview of the project management processes and development practices used by OctoAcme. It is derived from the comprehensive [Development Guide](how-to-develop.md) and related process documentation maintained in this repository.

## Developer Environment and Onboarding

OctoAcme emphasizes clear ownership and iterative delivery across all projects. New developers joining a project participate in a structured kickoff meeting where they learn about the project charter, stakeholder groups, and high-level timelines as documented in the project initiation phase. The team uses GitHub Projects with standardized board columns (Backlog, Ready, In Progress, In Review, QA, Done) to track work items. Developers are expected to familiarize themselves with the project's Definition of Done, acceptance criteria templates, and the branching/PR conventions documented in the repository. While specific environment setup steps may vary by project, the execution and tracking documents outline the expectation for small, testable increments and participation in daily standups and weekly delivery syncs.

## Development Workflows and Iterative Debugging

Development follows a pull request workflow that prioritizes small PRs (ideally ≤ 400 lines) with clear issue links and acceptance criteria included in the PR description. Automated tests and linting run in CI before requesting review, and at least one approval is required before merging (or as defined by team policy). The team rhythm includes daily 15-minute standups focused on progress, blockers, and dependencies, as well as weekly delivery syncs to show progress and flag risks. Demos or reviews occur at the end of each sprint or milestone. Quality and testing practices include writing unit tests for new logic, integration tests where applicable, and end-to-end smoke tests for critical flows before release. Security scanning is performed in CI, and manual QA is conducted for feature acceptance when needed. Blocker escalation follows a three-level process: team-level triage in standups, PM escalation to product leads and dependent teams, and sponsor-level escalation for business-impacting issues.

## Personas, Roles, and Communication Channels

OctoAcme projects are staffed with clearly defined roles: Project Managers coordinate delivery, schedules, risk, and communications; Product Managers define outcomes, prioritize the backlog, and measure success; Developers implement features and collaborate on design and testability; and QA/Testing validates quality and acceptance criteria. Communication cadence is structured around weekly syncs between PM and Product Manager, twice-weekly standups for the delivery team (or as agreed), and monthly stakeholder updates, with ad-hoc escalations as needed. Developers typically communicate through daily standups, sprint planning sessions, PR descriptions and code review comments, and technical design documents when required. Stakeholder communication uses a single source of truth (often the project README or release document) and follows templates for weekly status updates (progress, next steps, risks/blockers, decisions needed) and incident communications.

## Quality Assurance Practices and Limitations

Quality assurance at OctoAcme is integrated throughout the development lifecycle. Teams track velocity and burndown, monitor success metrics identified in the project one-pager, and use dashboards for key signals such as errors, latency, and usage. The execution checklist ensures that branching and PR conventions are documented in the repository, CI is configured for tests and linting, regular demos are scheduled, and the risk register is updated weekly. Teams maintain a risk register capturing ID, description, impact, probability, owner, mitigation plan, and status for each identified risk. While the documentation provides a comprehensive framework for quality practices, teams should be aware that certain limitations may apply depending on the specific project context. For example, some prototype or demo systems may use in-memory data stores which do not persist data across restarts—such limitations should be explicitly documented in the project README or acceptance criteria to avoid confusion during testing and review phases.
